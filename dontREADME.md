// yapping session:
this was a quick game project that I made for my final. before making this, part of me wanted a solid point but the other part doesn't wanna makes some classic stuffs. 
so I put myself in hell via making a whole platformer game based on the tutorial on youtube while added some more feature as I learn. either way, I hope you enjoy this if you ever stump upon this thing

the project took about 2 days and a half to do, minus the report and presentation.


apparently, due to the fee of 4.99$ a month in order to export this as executable (.exe) you'll have to download the official yoyo GMS2 and run the folder in order to try the game. sorry for the inconvinient
