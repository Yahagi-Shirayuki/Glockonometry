// yapping session:
this was a quick game project that I made for my final. before making this, part of me wanted a solid point but the other part doesn't wanna makes some classic stuffs. 
so I put myself in hell via making a whole platformer game based on the tutorial on youtube while added some more feature as I learn. either way, I hope you enjoy this if you ever stump upon this thing

the project took about 2 days and a half to do, minus the report and presentation.
